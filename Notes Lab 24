check root for null to see if its empty

// add value to tree - 4 conditions

check for null first

create node when null - option 1
subroot = new BSTNode(value) need * and &

1. tree is empty
if root = null point to 5 and size++

2. value is smaller then root
go left

3. value is larger then root
go right

4. value is same as root - dont insert at all 
return

// recusrsion stop case
go left or right until reach null
if root - subroot is null, exit


// clear the tree
to clear tree we need post order - delete each node
if subroot = null, dont delete

subroot != null
otherwise, go left, go right, delete
clear the left, clear right, clear root
clear(subroot -> left)
clear(subroot -> right)
delete subroot;

// output in order - inorder
as long as root != Null
go left, vist root, go right
need stringstream
ss << tostring(subroot -> left) << subroot contents << tostring(subroot -> right)
