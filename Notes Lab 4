getline() gets input in as a string 

cin gets input as multiple types but doesnt allow for white spaces 

cin.ignore(1000, '\n') 

.get - gets a single character and removes it 

.peek() - gets the character and leaves it



        //StringStream
        
*/ a stream that stores ecerything as a string
* # include <sstream> and <iosstream> then declare std::stringstream ss; 
* use the same way as cin 
* output ss << my_string;
* input ss>> my_string;
* most time will be outputting and returning as a string 

    Example:

int age, new_age;
string name_age, name;

stringstream ss;

cout << "please enter age";
cin >> age;
cin.ignore(1000. '\n');
cout << "enter name";
getline(cin, name) 

//cout << "hello "  << name << " you are " << age << " years old." << endl; // prints to terminal
ss << "hello "  << name << " you are " << age << " years old." << endl;
// wont output to terminal so 
name_age = ss.str();   // better to have data in a variable that is saved and can be used 
cout << name_age; 

//create new ss 
stringstream ss_with_var(name_age); 

//right now buffer is what the user input is

while(!isdigit(ss_with_var.peek())) {   //peek will look at first char in buffer isdigit sees if its a digit(#)
    ss_with_var.ignore(1);   // if it isnt a digit throw it away until we hit the char digit then exit loop. 

}

ss_with_var >> new_age;
cout << "age extracted was " << new_age << endl;  


        // Functions
        
prepare for display 
output the array and seperate it by the seperator char with no trailing char

// hasvalue 
search for the value in the array, true if found. false is not. Will need a loop to look for it

// valueat 
find the thing at the spot, index valid not less than 0 or greater to equal of value

// sum
take 0 and add each element to that (start at 0!) 

// swapvalue 
have a temp to store the value in and swap them. 


   // Assignment 
   
26 letters in the alphabet, mod by 26 %26 for any number to get it between 0 and 25 
for numbers that go above or below the bounds, have to add or subtract 26.
