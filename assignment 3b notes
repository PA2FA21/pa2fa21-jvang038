// in the constructor 

todoitem is a dynamic array  *todoitem // new with []
capacity - how many can it possibly hold 
size - the size of items actually in the list size_ = 25

need a pointer to todoitem list_ the type is todoitem**

// destructor

delete todoitems, loops through size
then frees dynamic *todoitem

// memb func one
dont have to call new
takes dynamic array and brings it in 
add list[] size as long as size != 25 

increasing capacity in later class

// deleteitem

delete something and move everything down...

// membfunc 7
