BASE class name: Item
Filenames: item.h/item.cpp

Private Data Members:
  name_, string containing the name of the item
  value_, unsigned int containing the value of the item
	
Public Constructors/Destructor:
  Constructor with 2 parameters for private member variables.
    -Default arguments for name_("item") and value_(0)
  Virtual Destructor, does nothing
	
Accessors:
  name
  value

Mutators:
  set_name
  set_value
	
Public Function:	
  ToString, Returns string with name and value
			  Format --  NAME, $VALUE
	          EXAMPLE -- shoes, $25

DERIVED class name: FoodItem (base Item)
Filenames: food_item.h/food_item.cpp

Private Data Members:
	calories_, unsigned int
	unit_of_measure_, string (such as "ounces")
	units_, double
	
Public Constructors/Destructor:
  Constructor with 5 parameters for private member variables of this class and parent.
    -Default arguments for name_("fooditem"), value_(0), calories_(0),
	                       unit_of_measure_("nounits"), units_(0).
	-Calls Item constructor in its initialization section with name and value
	Virtual Destructor, does nothing

Accessors:
	calories
	unit_of_measure
	units
	
Mutators:
	set_calories
	set_unit_of_measure
	set_units

Public Function:	
	ToString, Returns string with name, value, units and unit of measure, calories. 
			  Units formatted to exactly two decimal places
	          (uses Item::ToString in its implementation)
			  Format -- NAME, $VALUE, UNITS UNITOFMEASURE, CALORIES calories
			  EXAMPLE -- cookie, $1, 2.50 cookie(s), 250 calories

Public Constructors/Destructor:
  Constructor with 4 parameters for private member variables of this class and parent.
    -Default arguments for name_("magicitem"), value_(0)
	                       description_("no description"), mana_required_(0).
	-Calls Item constructor in its initialization section with name and value
  Virtual Destructor, does nothing

Accessors:  
  description
  mana_required

Mutators:
  set_description
  set_mana_required
	
Public Function:
	ToString, returns string with name, value, description, mana required
	          (uses Item::ToString in its implementation)

A Makefile has been included with this exercise. Your options are:
make (Tries to compile your exercise)
make style (Checks your file for some styling mistakes. Note this does not check
            variable / function names / all indentation)
make clean (Removes the executable)

Please note you need to follow programming style guidelines for this exercise.

Exercises having the following will lose 10% per category:
- Code (such as output statements) not explicitly required
- Bad Programming Style (Variable Names, Formatting)

Exercises that DO NOT COMPILE will receive a ZERO!

NOTE: Exercises that compile with warnings will be treated as if they did not
      compile. (i.e. they will receive a zero)
