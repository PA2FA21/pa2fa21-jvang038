Complete the functions given in the lab.cpp file.

A Makefile has been included with this exercise. Your options are:
make (Tries to compile your exercise)
make style (Checks your file for some styling mistakes. Note this does not check
            variable / function names / all indentation)
make clean (Removes the executable)

Please note you need to follow programming style guidelines for this exercise.

Exercises having the following will lose 10% per category:
- Code (such as output statements) not explicitly required
- Bad Programming Style (Variable Names, Formatting)

Exercises that DO NOT COMPILE will receive a ZERO!

NOTE: Exercises that compile with warnings will be treated as if they did not
      compile. (i.e. they will receive a zero)
